Mango shake is simply made by blending chopped ripe & sweet mangoes with milk. In this basic recipe of a mango shake, some additional ingredients can be included.

The addition of these ingredients makes the mango shake thin or thick or creamy. I have mentioned below these ingredients that will help you in getting the consistency you want – be it thick, rich, thin or creamy.

Cream – when you add some whipping cream to any shake you get a thick & creamy consistency. In this recipe, you can Add about ¼ cup heavy cream. whipped cream can also be topped over the milkshake while serving
Whole milk – whole milk or full-fat milk gives a rich tasting shake. That said, even-toned milk or skimmed milk can be added.
Nut milk – sometimes I also make mango shake with almond or coconut milk. I have earlier shared a Vegan mango milkshake recipe. you can easily make a vegan mango shake by using cashew milk, almond milk, soy milk or coconut milk.
Ice cream – while blending, adding a vanilla ice cream or mango ice cream will definitely make mango shake thick, creamy and rich. Add 1 to 2 scoops of ice cream. Only use vanilla or mango ice cream as both these ice creams go well in the mango milkshake.
Ice cubes – to thin the milkshake considerably, add 6 to 7 ice cubes. You can even add less number of ice cubes. I always add 2 to 3 ice cubes while blending so that the milkshake is chilled when I serve it.
